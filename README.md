This app focuses on a collection of data on satellites and their attributes, such as orbit type (low earth orbit (LEO), medium earth orbit (MEO), geostationary orbit (GEO), etc.), launch information (launch date, vehicle, or site), and country of origin. The app takes in the data and can perform CRUD operations with examples shown in the consumer file as well as generate plots of orbit types by country as well as plots of country by orbit types, gaining insight into the preferred orbits of each country and the multinational composition of satellites at different altitudes. See /docs for deployment and usage instructions.
